# Sanskar News

Uses NewsAPI to search the internet for news and displays it in a structured format for anyone to view.
Also, you can search for a particular news yourself.

Huge thanks to CodeWithHarry, I learned React from your videos.
Thanks Ankeet Maini, Darsh Shah for your Infinite Scroll component which I used in this project.
Thanks Klendi Goci for your Loading Bar which I also used.
